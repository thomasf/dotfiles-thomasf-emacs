;;       (setq user-full-name "Your Full Name")
;;       (setq smtpmail-smtp-server "your.smtp.server.jp")

;;       (setq message-send-mail-function 'message-smtpmail-send-it)
;;  1) Be sure to use the LATEST version of point-undo.el.
;;  2) Enable debugger. M-x toggle-debug-on-error or (setq debug-on-error t)
;;  3) Use Lisp version instead of compiled one: (load "point-undo.el")
;;  4) Do it!
;;  5) If you got an error, please do not close *Backtrace* buffer.
;;  6) M-x point-undo-send-bug-report and M-x insert-buffer *Backtrace*
;;  7) Describe the bug using a precise recipe.

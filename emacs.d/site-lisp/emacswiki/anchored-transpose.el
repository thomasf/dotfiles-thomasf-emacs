;;; Commentary:

;; `anchored-transpose' is an interactive autoload function to transpose
;; portions of a region around an anchor phrase.  In other words it swaps
;; two regions.
;;
;; See C-h f anchored-transpose <ret> for a complete description.

;;; Installing:

;; 1) Put anchored-transpose.el on your load path.
;; 2) Put the following 2 lines in your .emacs
;;    (global-set-key [?\C-x ?t] 'anchored-transpose)
;;    (autoload 'anchored-transpose "anchored-transpose" nil t)

;;; History:

;; 2004-09-24 RGB Seems useable enough to release.
;; 2004-10-15 RGB Only comments and doc strings were updated.
;; 2004-10-22 RGB Added support for 2 phrase selection.
;; 2004-12-01 RGB Added secondary selection support.
;; 2005-07-21 RGB Updated help text and comments.
;;                Added support for A  C B  D and C  A D  B selection.
;;                Fixed bug affecting multi line selections.
;; 2005-09-28 RGB Allow swapping regions with no anchor text between.
;; 2005-10-17 RGB Fix bug in fuzzy logic which turned off fuzziness.

  "Transpose portions of the region around an anchor phrase.

`this phrase but not that word'    can be transposed into
`that word but not this phrase'

I want this phrase but not that word.
       |----------------------------|. .This is the entire phrase.
                  |-------|. . . . . . .This is the anchor phrase.

First select the entire phrase and type \\[anchored-transpose].  Then select
the anchor phrase and type \\[anchored-transpose] again.  By default the
anchor phrase will automatically include any surrounding whitespace even if
you don't explicitly select it.  Also, it won't include certain trailing
punctuation.  See `anchored-transpose-do-fuzzy' for details.  A prefix arg
prior to either selection means `no fuzzy logic, use selections literally'.

You can select the anchor phrase first followed by the entire phrase if more
convenient.  Typing \\[anchored-transpose] with nothing selected clears any
prior selection.  If both primary and secondary selections are active this
command swaps the 2 selections immediately.

I want this phrase but not that word.
       |----------|       |---------|   Separate phrase selection.

You can also select the phrases to be swapped separately in any order.

Example: if (buffer-string beg end) contains `1234' the regexp `432' matches
it, not `234' as `looking-back' would.  Also, your regexp never sees the char
at BEG so the match will always leave at least 1 character to transpose.
The reason for not using looking-back is that it's not greedy enough.
